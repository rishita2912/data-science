Analysis of diverse data, inclusive analysis, coding, math.Data science takes unstructured data and finds order and meaning,
Venn Daigram of data Science:
contains of 3 things- coding, stats, domain
statiscal coding: R and python, Data bases: SQL
Command Line : Bash, Maths: Probabiltiy, algebra, regresseion, diagonosis problems.
Domain: Expertise in field, goals methods and constraints, can implement well.
ML : Coding and math without domain, blackbox models.

Planning: define goals   organise resourse   coordinate people   schedule project 
Data prep: Get data   Clean data   Explore data  Refine data.
Modelling: Create Model  Validate model  Evaluate model  Refine Model.
Follow up: Present Model  Deploy model  Revisit model  Archive assests.

Data science can help BI to identify data sources and set up framework, help get pat easy questions and data
BI is very goal oriented.
API: Application Program Interface which allows communicate.
Scraping for web data without APUs. Make data exactly what you need.
GIGO: Garbage in, garbage out.
Apps: Spreadsheets, Tableau for data visualization, SPSS, Jasp.
Web Data: HTML, XML, JSON.
Code: R, python, sql, c,c++ and java, bash, regrex.
The goal of machine learning is to work in data space by dimension reduction, clustering,k-means and anamolies
Categories: logistic regression, KNN , naiive bayes, decision tress
Major element of machine learning is linear regression, ensemble models.

ML can be used to categorize and pridict ,goal is useful insight.
Store the data in the CSV files, place the files in github, code in python or R.
